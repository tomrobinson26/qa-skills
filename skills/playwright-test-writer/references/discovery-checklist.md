# Discovery checklist

Concrete commands for step 1. This is only about locating where files go and how they're imported — the testing conventions themselves are fixed (`pom-patterns.md`, `spec-patterns.md`), not something to derive here.

## 1. Find the test files and their POM counterparts

```bash
# Playwright specs are usually *.spec.ts / *.spec.js, sometimes *.test.ts
find . -type f \( -name "*.spec.ts" -o -name "*.spec.js" -o -name "*.test.ts" \) -not -path "*/node_modules/*"

# The directory holding page-object / component classes is usually named
# one of: pages, page-objects, objects, poms, models, screens
find . -type d \( -iname "pages" -o -iname "page-objects" -o -iname "objects" -o -iname "poms" -o -iname "models" -o -iname "screens" \) -not -path "*/node_modules/*"
```

Open a couple of spec files and their paired classes just to confirm: is there a base/shared page object that other page objects build on, and does it already carry shared chrome (nav, footer, banners)?

## 2. Find the fixture/support layer

```bash
grep -rl "test.extend\|test.use\|createBrowserContext\|customFixture" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules
```

If found, this file is the one specs should import `test`/`expect` from instead of the raw framework package — check its exports.

## 3. Find import/path-alias conventions

```bash
cat tsconfig.json 2>/dev/null | grep -A 20 '"paths"'
cat jsconfig.json 2>/dev/null | grep -A 20 '"paths"'
# Also check vite.config.*, webpack.config.*, or babel config for resolve aliases
```

If aliases exist, existing specs/POMs will already be using them (`@components/X`, `~/pages/X`, etc.) — match that, don't introduce relative `../../` imports where an alias exists, and don't invent an alias that isn't configured.

## 4. Find how to run things

```bash
cat package.json | grep -A 30 '"scripts"'
```

Look for lint, typecheck (`tsc`, `type-check`), and test-run scripts, and whether running tests requires an environment variable, `--project` flag, or config file to target a specific environment/browser. Also check for a `playwright.config.*` — its `projects` array reveals device/browser variants and any tag-based `grep`/`grepInvert` filtering, which matters if the new feature has `@desktop`/`@mobile`-tagged blocks.

## 5. Optional: check for repo-specific rules layered on top

A quick look at the ESLint config (`eslint.config.*`/`.eslintrc*`) for `eslint-plugin-playwright` and any custom `no-restricted-syntax`/`no-restricted-imports` rules can surface constraints specific to this repo beyond the fixed conventions above (an unusual banned API, an extra required naming pattern). Treat anything found here as additive, not as a reason to deviate from the fixed conventions.

## 6. Optional: cache what you found

If this repo doesn't already have a `references/this-repo.md` next to this skill and you expect to write tests here again, consider writing a short one after you finish — just the plumbing (directory layout, alias style, fixture wrapper name, run commands, a representative file or two) so the next invocation can skip straight to step 2.
